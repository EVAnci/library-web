## Instalation and execution

### Instalation

There are two ways of installing and executing the scritps located in the backend folder. If you want to install and get the python venv activated, you should execute this command:

```bash
cd backend && source install.sh
```

If you only want to create the venv and let the venv deactivated:

```bash
cd backend && ./install.sh
```
### Execution

To execute flask, you should create a .env file following the .env-example file. 

```bash
cd backend
cp .env-example .env
```

Then if you want to run (located in the backend folder of the proyect):

```bash
./boot.sh
```

> [IMPORTANT]
> The PORT variable in the .env file should be in the first line for the correct working of the boot script.
