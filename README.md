## Instalation and execution

### Instalation

There are two ways of installing and executing the scritps located in the backend folder. If you want to install and get the python venv activated, you should execute this command:

```bash
cd backend && source install.sh
```

If you only want to create the venv and let the venv deactivated:

```bash
cd backend && ./install.sh
```
### Execution

#### Backend

To execute the backend, you should create a .env file following the .env-example file. 

```bash
cd backend
cp .env-example .env
```

To install all dependency packages run the install script located at the backend directory.

```bash
./install.sh
```

This script will create a python venv and install required packages for you. But if you want to do it manually by yourself, just create and activate a python venv, install all required packages (listed in requirements.txt file). You can follow this example:

```bash
# In the backend directory
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then to run the backend:

```bash
./boot.sh
```

The advantage of the boot script is that it will offer you to fill up the database with testing data. However, if you just want to run it:

```bash
# with the python venv activated run
python3 app.py
```

#### Frontend

To run the frontend of the proyect you need `npm` and `Angular`. When all installed run:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

That will install all dependencies needed to run the frontend. Then, to start the frontend:

```bash
ng serve -o
```
